Taking place from June to September, the young social entrepreneurs are given access to high-quality learning content on HP LIFE, tools and technology for start-up acceleration.\n\nParticipants receive dedicated coaching, mentoring and customized support during the programme, as well as the opportunity to tap into a diverse global network of potential supporters and investors.\n\nOne of the successful teams in the first pitch \u2013 held online over two days on 25 and 26 July \u2013 was \u2018I Hear U\u2019 from Mexico. Their project promotes mental health for youth through technology, offering a solution that provides low-cost therapy, free emotional support, a supportive community, and valuable content and live sessions.\n\n\u201cMental health is a concern worldwide, with the high cost and limited access to services, yet only around 2% of health budgets on average are allocated to mental health,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Vel\u00e1zquez, team leader of \u2018I Hear U\u2019. The main challenge for Ra\u00fal\u2019s team is creating good partnerships, and Raul says that the mentoring received through BeChangeMaker has been extremely helpful.\n\nAnother team through to the next phase is an initiative in Uganda that aims at ensuring economic inclusion for refugees through self-reliance and women empowerment.\n\n\u201cRefugees often only receive bare necessities, but they rarely have the chance to earn a living,\u201d says Chantal Braunwalder, the Director and Founder of Team Spirit International.\n\n\u201cUganda offers the ground for change, with self-reliance as a key policy and providing refugees with land for cultivation. However, refugees still suffer from food insecurity and lack of livelihoods.\u201d Coming from six different countries, their team identifies and bridges gaps in the agricultural supply chain and offering vocational training in agro-ecology and business.\n\nAnd from Azerbaijan, a human right lawyer joined a mobile app developer to help persons with disabilities know and attain their rights.\n\n\u201cCollaboration has been at the heart of our project\u2019s success,\u201d says team leader Reyham Ramazanova. \u201cWorking together with the BeChangeMaker team, coach, and mentors has allowed us to pool diverse perspectives and ideas, leading to better development and refinement of our project. The opportunity to design, improve, and collaborate throughout this journey has been transformative, setting the foundation for a successful and impactful project.\u201d\n\nOnly 5 of the 15 teams currently in the programme will be selected to take part in the intensive coaching, mentorship, and premium services that will take place during the last six weeks of the programme.\n\nTheir ideas will again be put to the test on 9 August during a second pitch deciding which businesses will go to the finals.\n\nGo to the BeChangeMaker website for more information on this year\u2019s and past participants.\n\n"

Four of the five competition modules were digital - hence the challenge. The solution was to design them in a way that would prepare participants for the cooks\u2019 apprenticeship certification exam, but also demonstrate their skills with online tests or self-made videos.\n\nThis new way of thinking was embraced by instructors, says Thorben Gr\u00fcbnau, Vice President North of the German Chefs\u2019 Association, WorldSkills Germany Expert and initiator and driving force behind the competition.\n\n\u201cTrainers approached me and thanked me for the fact that the structure of the Competition had finally given them impulses on how to implement the topic of digitalisation in training,\u201d he says.\n\n\"The competition thrives on the high standard of the examinations and thus generates a visible added value for the qualitative training of skilled workers.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the year, 40 young chefs registered for what would be the first National Skills Competition of Young Chefs. Over 20 then battled through the preliminary round of four digital-only modules.\n\nOnly then did the final seven compete face to face in the final.\n\n\u201cWith this kind of competition - digital and analogue - it was our concern to keep participation low-threshold and at the same time create a great added value for the participants,\" says Gr\u00fcbnau.\n\nThe challenge for training and recruiting a skilled workforce is to \u201cMake young people enjoy their jobs and at the same time give them the feeling that you are working with them on their strengths and weaknesses and are there to give them advice,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWith the principle of \u2018learning in Competition\u2019 in the form of the National Competition for Young Chefs, we enable precisely this unique professional and personal development of young chefs.\"\n\nThe format of the competition allowed the young chefs to get feedback after each module, learning where they had lost points and how they could improve.\n\nOnline tasks included creating a main dish from a shopping basket of ingredients, using a smartphone for food photography, cutting up a guinea fowl and being able to carry out a conversation in simple English - an essential skill for international Competitions.\n\nThe final challenge was to cook a main course for eight people. Participants were only informed on site that two of the eight judges were children, so they had to spontaneously prepare two children\u2019s dishes from the available ingredients.\n\nThe winner was 22-year-old Lennart Zankl from L\u00fcbeck, who is completing a course in food management.\n\n\u201cThe pressure during the final was enormous. That was the first time for me to experience something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a little proud of myself, but I am also happy about all the experience I have gained here.\n\n"

As he looked through their course prospectus, he was drawn to CAD design.\n\n\u201cEverything you see on the roads or at home has been built by someone, and that person put together a project to build it. And that\u2019s what I like, we can design anything and make it happen in real life. We have no limits with CAD software,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o.\n\nHis WorldSkills journey started soon after joining the centre. He immediately began practising and watching other Competitors, dedicating time to completing Test Projects to improve himself and prepare to compete.\n\nHe competed at the WorldSkills Portugal nationals, progressed to EuroSkills, and finally reached the world championship. At WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition in Bordeaux, France he won a gold medal in Mechanical Engineering CAD.\n\nNow, at 22, Jo\u00e3o is an instructor at the very same vocational centre where he honed his skill. He trains young people from the ages of 15 to 20 in CAD designing, and soon in 3D metal printing.\n\n\u201cWe have recently acquired a 3D printer in metal and I am learning the machine to give training for the others in the future,\u201d he says.\n\nAn instructor during the day, at night he is studying mechanical engineering at the polytechnic to get to the next level. He discovered a passion for cars when he started to learn how they were designed and built and realized that his future would not necessarily be always behind a computer. While he is enjoying every step of the journey, in the long term, he pictures himself managing design projects or heading a production line.\n\nOne of his goals as part of the WorldSkills Champions Trust is to change the public\u2019s perceptions on vocational education and training, and to advocate for policy action.\n\n\u201cIn Portugal, we have lack technicians. Everyone wants to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. We have a lot of engineers that can make the project and select the materials\u2026 But they don\u2019t know how to join them. It\u2019s eventually the tradespersons who teach them how to join the parts,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o.\n\nMany graduates are not fit for the available jobs, and are often left frustrated by pay scales that do not match their initial expectations.\n\nJo\u00e3o hopes to spread awareness of the WorldSkills movement across Portugal and Europe and remind young Competitors that there is more to WorldSkills than earning a medal.\n\n\u201cI was so focused on succeeding that I didn\u2019t talk with many people during the breaks. I never spoke with anyone. And I regret that because WorldSkills is also about meeting new people, from different cultures and I missed on that,\u201d he says.\n\nNow that he is part of the WorldSkills Champions Trust, he says he wants to be the person that makes the group more united and makes everyone feel happy and positive.\n\n"

Their positive attitude to vocational skills, \u201cbrings joy to be here with them,\u201d said S\u00f8ren Heisel, Chair of SkillsDenmark.\n\nIt was also clear young people were increasingly following a green agenda, he said. \u201cIn the vocational training courses around the country, there is a great focus on sustainability, and this could also be seen at many of the competition stands.\u201d\n\nMarch saw a burst of national competitions, including Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and the Netherlands.\n\nAs Portugal ended its competition, EmiratesSkills was beginning theirs at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, the venue for WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017. Over 50 young men and women won gold, silver, and bronze medals in 23 skill competitions. It was the largest national vocational skills competition in the UAE and was watched by the country\u2019s vice president Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed.\n\nMarch concluded with the Grand Est Regional Finals at the city of Metz in France, and the 10th International Abilympics, the skills global competition for people with disabilities, organized in partnership with WorldSkills France.\n\nSkillsLatvia and WordSkills Hong Kong shared the spotlight in April and May holding national competitions on different sides of the world.\n\nFour new skills \u2014 Bakery, Hotel Reception, Freight Forwarding, and IT Network Systems Administration \u2014 were added to the Hong Kong national competition, with the winners now preparing for WorldSkills Lyon 2024.\n\nAlso in Asia, it was the turn of WorldSkills Thailand, whose 29th national competition was held across six venues in late May.

Thirty-six projects came forward, some led by former WorldSkills Experts and Competitors.\n\n\u201cINNOVATEP aimed to be a space to celebrate the talent of skilled Dominicans, where they could showcase their capabilities to innovate. The idea was to promote the development of soft skills such as team work and interdisciplinary collaboration, and support them so they would feel free to combine their skills in the way they deemed appropriate,\u201d says Rosanny Contreras, the project\u2019s coordinator.\n\nThe institute engaged an international consultant to provide mentoring and support to the teams in developing the technical part of their projects. INFOTEP helped them in administrative aspects such as project drafting, developing budgets for prototypes, and marketing.\n\nAlexander Grull\u00f3n, a bronze Medalist at WorldSkills America Chile 2018 for Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, came up with a beach fridge.\n\nThe fridge works with an inverter, providing seven to eight hours of cooling without having to be plugged in. A boon for picnickers, ice-cream vendors and shopkeepers, the invention could also be used to transport and refrigerate medicines in rural areas or zones with an unstable power supply.\n\n\u201cThe interesting part is that it has a chip that controls the speed according to the inside temperature. Well, this chip was developed thanks to our colleagues in the electronics department here at INFOTEP Cibao Norte,\u201d explains Alexander, evidence of the type of cross-departmental collaborations that took place.\n\nAnother project, called Vortex, uses a chatbot to streamline communication with prospective VET students. Its developer, Cristian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, competed in Web Technologies at WorldSkills S\u00e3o Paulo 2015.\n\nUsing Google\u2019s DialogFlow technology, he developed a chatbot that goes beyond helping students find the right skill for them and how to enroll.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to obtain metadata on the courses that are most in demand, about demographics of prospective students, or what are the courses that work best depending on regions. This way, we can better plan the offer of INFOTEP and our strategy as an institution,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother of the projects \u2013 a tiny house which has everything a person may need \u2013 was developed between the electrical and the woodworking departments. WorldSkills Americas 2012 Expert in Cabinetmaking, Juan Leonardo, explains that the idea came to them after reading that the Dominican Republic has a 60 percent housing deficit.\n\nTheir project has already attracted private investors, and INFOTEP is providing them support in terms of copyright and patenting.\n\nThe 36 projects have now entered a new phase, where they will receive specific training and mentoring on entrepreneurship. Furthermore, acknowledging the country\u2019s financial obstacles for start-ups and small enterprises, INFOTEP and the Government of the Dominican Republic are working jointly to provide interest-free credits that can help teams accelerate their ideas.\n\nThe Dominican Republic, through INFOTEP, has been a member of WorldSkills Americas since 2010, and of WorldSkills International since 2012.\n\n"

        "Content": "A new study by the World Bank, the ILO, and UNESCO brings together global knowledge on Technical Vocational and Education Training (TVET) reforms to create guidelines for low and middle-income countries.\n\nThe \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems: Principles and Practice in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\u201d\u00a0report is considered the first rigorous global analysis of TVET challenges and reforms in developing economies.\n\nDespite TVET\u2019s potential to curb alarming global youth unemployment rates and promote sustainable development, the report says that TVET systems in many low and middle-income countries are unprepared for the forecasted rise in demand. The report outlines how large skill mismatches between labour market needs are derived from globalization, technological progress, demographic transformation, and climate change.\n\nTVET systems often underperform due to difficulties facing learners, unsupported teachers, and weak incentives for training providers. Based on lessons learned from TVET reforms and the COVID-19 pandemic, the report offers three fundamental transformations to create better TVET systems.\n\nIt encourages TVET providers to move \u201cfrom striving for recognition, to striving for excellence,\u201d and suggests providers take a client-oriented approach towards both enterprises and learners, prioritize foundational skills, and impart relevant technical skills, and promote an integrated ecosystem that allows flexibility, fosters quality, and engages teachers.\n\nThe report also recommends a focus on end results, which translates into strengthening the government\u2019s role in quality assurance, empowering enterprises and learners to use their client power, and realigning TVET funding to reward reforms and results. Finally, it calls for governments to increase data collection so that decisions and systemic reforms are driven by evidence.\n\nLaunched on 12 July through a virtual event \u2013 \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems\u201d \u2013 aligned with celebrations around World Youth Skills Day.\n\nThe report was published live by the World Bank Vice President for Human Development, the ILO Assistant Director General for Jobs and Social Protection, the UNESCO Assistant Director General for Education, and representatives from government, TVET institutions, and youth.\n\nIt was then followed by a presentation of the key messages, and a panel discussion under the title \u201cLessons on TVET reforms in L/MICs.\u201d WorldSkills Champions Trust representative for Asia, Shweta Ratanpura, from India, participated in the panel alongside policymakers from Ecuador, Ethiopia, and the Philippines.\n\nShweta shared her experience in pursuing a TVET career in India. While explaining how TVET is perceived as a second-tier track, along with societal and gender biases, she stressed the need for more awareness of the career opportunities, pay scales, and work conditions in TVET careers. This information, she said, is scarce and hard to obtain.\n\n\u201cEnrolling in extracurricular courses and external classes helped me build my skill over the years. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important that vocational training is included in the education system early on. If it\u2019s part of the system more and more people would be encouraged to do the same,\u201d she said as she highlighted the effect of role models to engage more women in TVET.\n\n\u201cIn short, the most important takeaway is to bring change. Whether as a student, or as a parent, educator, or policymaker, we all hold the power to contribute to raising awareness, countering biases, and strengthening our education system,\u201d she concluded.\n\nA recording of the event and related information is available on the World Bank\u2019s official event page.\n\nDownload the full report \u201cBuilding Better Formal TVET Systems: Principles and Practice in Low- and Middle-Income Countries\u201d.\u00a0It will be available in French and Spanish in the near future.\n\n"

It brought together former WorldSkills Champions and apprentices, alongside policymakers and diverse stakeholders within the skills landscape in Germany and beyond.\n\nThe opening remarks were delivered by:\n\nAs she expressed her excitement to hear directly from the incredible skilled youth in the different panels, Laurence Gates, said it was their perspective, ideas, and challenging questions that should be heard on World Youth Skills Day, and every day.\n\n\u201cWe are all committed to helping you develop the skills you need for tomorrow, because our world is becoming more turbulent and uncertain. Change will only happen when educators, industries, and policymakers work together to redesign our VET systems for sustainable human and economic development,\u201d said Laurence Gates.\n\nThe first discussion included Aswatha Narayana Sanagavarapu, gold Medalist from WorldSkills Kazan 2019, taking part in a youth focus group on improving teaching and learning processes. With the added insights of a recent UNESCO-UNEVOC youth survey, the panel aimed at amplifying youth priorities and expectations for the future of skills development.\n\nAswatha, who competed in Water Technology, said that his WorldSkills journey was transformational for him.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to my experience as an engineering graduate, I saw that most often the knowledge is limited to the theoretical aspects, and it lacks the practical approach of the real world. Hence, I strongly believe competitions and apprenticeships can do a lot in bridging the gap of knowledge and skills,\u201d he said.\n\nThe focus group was followed by a panel around the theme for this year\u2019s World Youth Skills Day \u2013 Skilling teachers, trainers and youth for a transformative future. WorldSkills Champions Trust representative, Sonya Hill joined from Jamaica to share her experience of transitioning from school to work.\n\n\u201cRegardless of having and engineering degree and having competed at WorldSkills, there were skill gaps that hindered my performance in the work environment. I was provided by a solid theoretical foundation, but I got no exposure to practical experience and technologies used within industry, which made it very challenging for me to quickly adapt and effectively apply my knowledge,\u201d said Sonya.\n\nShe added that to better support youth, TVET institutions should frequently update their curricula, and machinery to match that of industry. Partnerships can provide opportunities for students to develop more practical skills while they are still in school to accelerate their readiness for the labour market.\n\nAs UNESCO\u2019s designated centre for technical and vocational education and training (TVET), UNESCO-UNEVOC supports Member States in their efforts to strengthen and upgrade their TVET systems and ensures access to quality skills training and development for all. UNESCO-UNEVOC is a partner of the WorldSkills Conference Coalition, and a long-term partner of WorldSkills.\n\n"

The research demonstrates that training tomorrow\u2019s leaders could pay back more than four-fold, representing as much as a \u00a34.50 return on every \u00a31 of investment made by the Department for Education.\n\nSource: Frontier Economics for WorldSkills UK\n\nTechnically skilled young people enjoy a greater financial return on their time, energy, and passion, finding themselves more employable, and more valuable to businesses. Those with the highest levels of technical prowess can earn on average \u00a314,000 more than their less-skilled peers.
